            The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The first version was released on October 23, 2001, about ​8 1⁄2 months after the Macintosh version of iTunes was released.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Portable MP3 players had been around since the mid 1990s, but Apple found existing digital music players "big and clunky or small and useless" with user interfaces that were "unbelievably awful". Apple thought flash memory-based players didn't carry enough songs and the hard drive based ones were too big and heavy so the company decided to develop its own.
